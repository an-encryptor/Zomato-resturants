Introduction:

Food is something that everyone loves. 
It's even a topic of conversation for everyone. Our conversations about food can last for many hours. 
India truly is known as the "Land of Spices." India is the world's largest producer of spices with over 200 different varieties. 
The arrival of numerous domestic and foreign players has caused an unparalleled upheaval in the Indian restaurant sector. Consequently, there is now a great need for qualified professionals in this industry and all related industries. In an effort to better serve their patrons and attract a larger clientele, Indian restaurants have now gone online, largely due to technological advancements.

However, the supply and demand graph isn't exactly as it should be.
The restaurant industry offers a wide range of opportunities that are just waiting to be taken advantage of, despite a noticeable shortage of skilled professionals.
Let's talk about culinary arts colleges. In response to demands from the industry, traditional culinary schools and hotel management colleges have now broadened the scope of their curricula.
Indian universities are devoting resources, both financial and temporal, to equipping students with employability skills.

When restaurants like McDonald's, Pizza Hut, Domino's Pizza, Subway and Yo!China opened in the nation in 1996, the revolution got underway. 
The market for food services has expanded steadily ever since.

The good news is that the food services industry is expected to expand for many years to come, thanks to rising disposable incomes, a larger population of younger people, the growth of consumers in smaller towns, and increased exposure to new cultures and cuisines, in addition to an increased proclivity to eat out.
